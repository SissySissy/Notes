# Bash

**Bash** (AKA **B**ourne **A**gain **Sh**ell) is a **type of interpreter** that processes shell commands.

the **terminal** is the **interface to the shell interpreter**.

Normally, a Bash script file has `.sh` extension to make it clear that it is a shell script file



### shebang

**shebang** is the character sequence consisting of the characters [number sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_sign) and [exclamation mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclamation_mark) (#!) at the beginning of a script. This line will make the text file executable

we can directly execute it like a binary but we need to put a [**shebang**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)) or **hashbang** line at the top of the file **to declare the** **interpreter**.

```
#! /usr/bin/env **bash**
\# *comment: use command ./make-files.sh*
ls -alh ./test
```



The path is absolute, but from computer to computer the location can change

Often, the program [/usr/bin/env](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Env) can be used to circumvent this limitation by introducing a level of [indirection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirection). `#!` is followed by /usr/bin/env, followed by the desired command without full path
