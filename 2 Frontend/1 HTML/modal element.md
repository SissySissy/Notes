# Modal

## Accessibility Issues

-   Keyboard focus should be moved inside of the modal and restored to the previous activeElement when the modal is closed
-   Keyboard focus should be trapped inside of the modal, so the user does not accidentally tab outside of the modal (a.k.a. "escaping the modal")
-   Screen readers should also be trapped inside of the modal to prevent accidentally escaping
