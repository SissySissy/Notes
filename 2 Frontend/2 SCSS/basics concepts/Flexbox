## Flex

### flexbasis
The  `flex-basis`  specifies the initial size of the flex item, before any available space is distributed according to the flex factors. When omitted from the  `flex`  shorthand, its specified value is the length zero.

A flex-basis value set to `auto` sizes the element according to its size property (which can itself be the keyword `auto`, which sizes the element based on its contents).

### order

    .active {
	    order:-1;
	    flex: 1 0 100%;
    }

this is useful when you have a screen reader for example, and you want to keep the html source order but showcase a different styling.
eg: date on a news article, you want the screen reader to read the title first and then the date, even when the style in css is different.

### flex shortcut syntax

    flex:
