The `**place-content**`  [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property is a [shorthand](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Shorthand_properties) for [`align-content`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-content "The CSS align-content property sets the distribution of space between and around content items along a flexbox's cross-axis or a grid's block axis.") and [`justify-content`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/justify-content "The CSS justify-content property defines how the browser distributes space between and around content items along the main-axis of a flex container, and the inline axis of a grid container."). It can be used in any layout method which utilizes both of these alignment values.

If the second value is not present, the first value is used for both, provided it is a valid value for both.
