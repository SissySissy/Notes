## exercices to do

implement the two examples of attractions (array to one, attract every one to anyone)

start to think of a project and prepare lesson 1 and 2

## Intro

    x = x +1;

the illusion of movement is created
the goal is to learn how to formalize this by using vectors:

## Part I semester physics engine

1. vectors (position, velocity and accellertion)
2. modelling forces (simulation natural world)
3. oscillation motion, angular rotation stuff
4. particles systems, Sto arrivando!arraylist inheritance and polimorphism
5. box2D, toxiclibs, vorletphisics  clothes and jellyfish

## PART II semester, mind, explicit behavour

6. steering forces. vehicles book seek a target
7. flocking
8. cellular automation
9. fractal pattern

##  Part III Intelligence

10. Evolution, algorithm
11. Neural Networks
